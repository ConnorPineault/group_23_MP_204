# Modelling Project Final Submission

Group 23's Modelling Project.

Brief Explaination: 

1 - This project models a slightly simplified version of standard poker. 
2 - This version includes 3 given (dealt) cards, and 2 cards that act as shared table cards (the river).
3 - The model determines the rank of each players hand, and uses the ranks to determine the winner.
4 - The model provides suggestions to the player on if the player should play, or fold the hand.
5 - The model also features a model accuracy function, which can determine the accuracy of the models predications over large sample sizes.

A more in depth description, break down, and analysis of the model can be found in the project report:

                                    GROUP_23_MP_204 > final > CISC 204_Modelling Report Final.docx

To explore the model, run the program through the run.py file:

                                    GROUP_23_MP_204 > run.py

Related Jape proofs both solved and explained can be found at:

This folder should contain the extra documents for the deliverables (D3) - (D5)

## Expected Items

* *this repository*: We will download the most recent version of your project (including this folder) on the due date.
* `proofs.jp`: Jape file containing sequents, as well as their proofs.
* `modelling_report.docx` or (`report.txt` and `report.pdf`): Include either the Word document for your documentation, or a link to the OverLeaf project inside of `report.txt` if that is what you chose to use for (D5). If you are using OverLeaf, include a compiled version here as `report.pdf`.


Welcome to our project for CISC/CMPE 204, a 3-card Poker game.
To run our game, you simply need to run the run.py file. Once you run run.py you will get a chance to play the game and see our model.
Classes.py is simply classes for Card and Hand.
functions.py are the functions we use in run.py
Num_Suits.py defines the suits and ranks in a deck of cards
run.py runs the game and model
test.py is just testing for the game

Under documents and final you will find this and the Jape explanations along with the jape proofs and the modelling_report.docx
