Welcome to our project for CISC/CMPE 204, a 3-card Poker game.
To run our game, you simply need to run the run.py file. Once you run run.py you will get a chance to play the game and see our model.
Classes.py is simply classes for Card and Hand.
functions.py are the functions we use in run.py
Num_Suits.py defines the suits and ranks in a deck of cards
run.py runs the game and model
test.py is just testing for the game

Under documents and final you will find this and the Jape explanations along with the jape proofs and the modelling_report.docx
