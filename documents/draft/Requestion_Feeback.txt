1)Are we coding our propositions and constraints in
    the right way?


2) What should the final product output? What should output look like in the end of runtime? 
    Are we seeking a specific goal of what should be outputted. Overall, what is our goal! 


3) Are we thinking too narowly, should we be taking into account cards of potential other players / dealer.

    3i) are we able to meet virtually to dicuss in further detail?
